:: a.pro
my first attempt of solving this problem,
reuse the idea of day 10 (ray-casting)
just need to generate the map from the input

:: a1.pro
when i get to part2, i realized that ray-casting is a no go,
the size of the map will be enormous.
Try implementing area calculation using Green's theorem,
with two path that was generated by "hugging" the "wall" from inside and outside.
It's faster because i only need to store the corner/vertex of the path
