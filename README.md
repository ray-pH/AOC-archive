This is a personal archive for my Advent of Code solutions

I started doing AOC in 2020, i believe i heard about it from [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily)

I used AOC as a great opportunity to learn a new language, a new programming paradigm

*I started writing this note in 2023, i don't really remember all the detail for the previous years, so i'll just write the quick summary for those years*

## 2023
This year, i use prolog.

## 2022
Before the start of AOC, i thought i'm going to use AOC 2022 to learn assembly. But after trying to write my first assembly code, i pretty much gave up on the idea. Assembly is far too simple of a "language". Sure maybe i can solve day 1 with it, but the entire AOC? No thanks. So instead, i continue using haskell.

This year, i solved all the problems (all part1 & part2) until day 18, i believe i got bored with it and started another project

*But i revisited the problems again in 2023. To make it quick, i use python and boy it was way easier. Maybe there's a real reason why functional programming isn't really that popular.*

## 2021
Second year, i believe at the start of AOC, i don't really know what language to use. And then, AOC started. Not knowing what to do, i just use haskell again, now with more familiarity with the language and the paradigm, but of course there's still a lot to learn.

This year, i solved all the problems (all part1 & part2) until day 22, and then i stopped. I think i have something else to do, maybe something university related, or maybe i'm just bored. It's just 3 more days, maybe i'll revisit and finish this later


## 2020
My First AOC, i use it to learn Haskell. I've never use Haskell before, this pure functional paradigm is still very new to me at that time. I kinda know what to expect with Haskell from watching [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily), but other than that, i know pretty much nothing about it.

Pure Functional Programming is a beast. It's so different from your standard imperative programming. At the end of the challenge, i became more familiar with haskell and the functional paradigm in general. I still remember that "changing" an element from a List is a hassle, especially for 2D List. But other than that, the logic is fun.

This year, i solved all of the part1 but i missed some of the part2 (not sure whether i'll revisit them again or not)
